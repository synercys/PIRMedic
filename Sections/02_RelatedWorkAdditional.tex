Vilica-Rocha~\etal~\cite{villca2021towards} presents a search engine for BMS data and metadata to enable easy management of building sensor data. They take in NLP queries (\eg ``rooms with six occupants on the first floor'') and retrives the time series data corresponding to it, and ranks it according to the relevance to the query. They use techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to aid this process.
