% Additionally, we would like to explore the efficiency of existing time-domain techniques such as LSTM and RNN models for the PIR sensor.

\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:concl}
The approach of using physics in conjunction with machine learning techniques can pave way for a dependable and reliable IoT. The analysis of intrinsic signals allows us to better understand the physics of a sensor that can aid in fault detection, diagnosis and maintenance of sensors. We show that in the case of PIR sensors, the appropriate use of intermediate analog signals offers potential to perform in-situ fault diagnosis thereby reducing costs and improving reliability. Due to lack of standard designs of PIR sensors, we propose that sensor vendors include the \aout signal in all PIR sensor designs to aid in the reliability of PIR sensors.
