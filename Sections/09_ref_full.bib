	abstract     = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the deployment of various types of sensors in the homes, offices, buildings, lawns, cities, and even in agricultural farms. Since IoT applications rely on the fidelity of data reported by the sensors, it is important to detect a faulty sensor and isolate the cause of the fault. Existing fault detection techniques demand sensor domain knowledge along with the contextual information and historical data from similar near-by sensors. However, detecting a sensor fault by analyzing just the sensor data is non-trivial since a faulty sensor reading could mimic non-faulty sensor data. This paper presents a novel primitive, which we call the Fall-curve - a sensor's voltage response when the power is turned off - that can be used to characterize sensor faults. The Fall-curve constitutes a unique signature independent of the phenomenon being monitored which can be used to identify the sensor and determine whether the sensor is correctly operating.We have empirically evaluated the Fall-curve technique on a wide variety of analog and digital sensors. We have also been running this system live in a few agricultural farms, with over 20 IoT devices. We were able to detect and isolate faults with an accuracy over 99%, which would have otherwise been hard to detect only by observing measured sensor data.},

	abstract     = {Pyroelectric Infra-Red (PIR) sensors are used in many applications including security. PIRs detect the presence of humans and animals from the radiation of their body heat. This could be used to trigger events, e.g., opening doors, recording video, etc. PIRs are used widely because of their low power consumption.Hitherto, PIR sensors were used for binary event generation -- human/animal present or not-present. At the same time simple binary output hinders the use of PIR sensors in a wide variety of sophisticated applications. In the literature, we find limited characterization of analog output from PIR sensors that could provide much more information.We built a simple array of PIR sensors and packaged them in a tower. We used two sets of four PIR sensors and tapped their analog signals after amplification. Our major contribution is the characterization of analog signals from the PIR sensors. We describe many interesting aspects obtained from the analog signals, which have not been explored until now. We also show their correspondence with the range, speed and size of the moving object. Using the characterization of PIR sensors analog data as well as simple binary decisions from these PIR sensors, we: (i) classify moving object with high precision; and (ii) localize the moving object. The major incentives are low operating power compared to WSNs.We achieve 30 cm accuracy in 80\% of the times, when ranging up to 5 m. Over multiple experiments for different persons in the range 1--10 m, we show that the error probability for localization is 0.08 at moderate distances (around 5--6 m). Our work will help in designing better detection and application triggers using PIR sensors in the near future. We believe that this work will open up new avenues in the development of new applications with PIR sensors.},

	abstract     = {Various sensor network measurement studies have reported instances of transient faults in sensor readings. In this work, we seek to answer a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real deployments? We focus on three types of transient faults, caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize four qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict “normal” sensor behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging anomalous sensor readings as faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods start with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is compared against its predicted value computed using time series forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods infer a model for the “normal” sensor readings using training data, and then statistically detect and identify classes of faults.We find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on the accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome to train, but can accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate, but cannot classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are more effective for detecting short duration faults than long duration ones, and incur more false positives than the other methods. We apply these techniques to four real-world sensor datasets and find that the prevalence of faults as well as their type varies with datasets. All four methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first step towards automated online fault detection and classification.},

Sensors at different locations can generate streaming data, which can be analyzed in real-time to identify events of interest. In this paper, we propose a framework that computes in a distributed fashion an approximation of multi-dimensional data distributions in order to enable complex applications in resource-constrained sensor networks.We motivate our technique in the context of the problem of outlier detection. We demonstrate how our framework can be extended in order to identify either distance- or density-based outliers in a single pass over the data, and with limited memory requirements. Experiments with synthetic and real data show that our method is efficient and accurate, and compares favorably to other proposed techniques. We also demonstrate the applicability of our technique to other related problems in sensor networks.},

	abstract     = {Urban air pollution monitoring with mobile, portable, low-cost sensors has attracted increasing research interest for their wide spatial coverage and affordable expenses to the general public. However, low-cost air quality sensors not only drift over time but also suffer from cross-sensitivities and dependency on meteorological effects. Therefore calibration of measurements from low-cost sensors is indispensable to guarantee data accuracy and consistency to be fit for quantitative studies on air pollution. In this work we propose sensor array network calibration (SCAN), a multi-hop calibration technique for dependent low-cost sensors. SCAN is applicable to sets of co-located, heterogeneous sensors, known as sensor arrays, to compensate for cross-sensitivities and dependencies on meteorological influences. SCAN minimizes error accumulation over multiple hops of sensor arrays, which is unattainable with existing multi-hop calibration techniques. We formulate SCAN as a novel constrained least-squares regression and provide a closed-form expression of its regression parameters. We theoretically prove that SCAN is free from regression dilution even in presence of measurement noise. In-depth simulations demonstrate that SCAN outperforms various calibration techniques. Evaluations on two real-world low-cost air pollution sensor datasets comprising 66 million samples collected over three years show that SCAN yields 16% to 60% lower error than state-of-the-art calibration techniques.},

	abstract     = {Frequent sensor calibration is essential in sensor networks with low-cost sensors. We exploit the fact that temporally and spatially close measurements of different sensors measuring the same phenomenon are similar. Hence, when calibrating a sensor, we adjust its calibration parameters to minimize the differences between co-located measurements of previously calibrated sensors. In turn, freshly calibrated sensors can now be used to calibrate other sensors in the network, referred to as multi-hop calibration.We are the first to study multi-hop calibration with respect to a reference signal (micro-calibration) in detail. We show that ordinary least squares regression---commonly used to calibrate noisy sensors---suffers from significant error accumulation over multiple hops. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop calibration algorithm using geometric mean regression, which (i) highly reduces error propagation in the network, (ii) distinctly outperforms ordinary least squares in the multi-hop scenario, and (iii) requires considerably fewer ground truth measurements compared to existing network calibration algorithms. The proposed algorithm is especially valuable when calibrating large networks of heterogeneous sensors with different noise characteristics. We provide theoretical justifications for our claims. Then, we conduct a detailed analysis with artificial data to study calibration accuracy under various settings and to identify different error sources. Finally, we use our algorithm to accurately calibrate 13 million temperature, ground ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements gathered by our mobile air pollution monitoring network.},

	abstract     = {Mobile sensing systems carried by individuals or machines make it possible to measure position- and time-dependent environmental conditions, such as air quality and radiation. The low-cost, miniature sensors commonly used in these systems are prone to measurement drift, requiring occasional re-calibration to provide accurate data. Requiring end users to periodically do manual calibration work would make many mobile sensing systems impractical. We therefore argue for the use of collaborative, automatic calibration among nearby mobile sensors, and provide solutions to the drift estimation and placement problems posed by such a system.Collaborative calibration opportunistically uses interactions among sensors to adjust their calibration functions and error estimates. We use measured sensor drift data to determine properties of time-varying drift error. We then develop (1) both optimal and heuristic algorithms that use information from multiple collaborative calibration events for error compensation and (2) algorithms for stationary sensor placement, which can further decrease system-wide drift error in a mobile, personal sensing system. We evaluated the proposed techniques using real-world and synthesized human motion traces. The most advanced existing work has 23.2\% average sensing error, while our collaborative calibration technique reduces the error to 2.2\%. The appropriate placement of accurate stationary sensors can further reduce this error.},

This paper addresses the challenge of fault detection in the CMOS circuits, using two bio-inspired structures based on the HP lab’s memristor and the BSIM3v3.2.2 transistor models. The first fault detection circuit (FDC) includes the memristor-based synapses and a modified leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)-based neuron. The memristor-based synapse circuits can be further optimized which is the proposed second fault detection method (O-FDC), and it has a lower hardware overhead and power consumption compared to the former. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed structures can detect the circuit faults under the inputs of direct current (DC), alternating current (AC) voltage sources, and pulse signals. Under the input of DC, the fault detection times for the two proposed structures are about 0.16 ms and 1.2 ms, respectively; when the input source is AC, the corresponding fault detection times are about 0.206 ms and 0.758 ms; and it takes only 6.47us for fault detection under the input of pulse signals. This work provides an alternative solution to enhance the fault-tolerant capability of the hardware systems.}

	abstract     = {Sensor networks have become an important source of data with numerous applications in monitoring various real-life phenomena as well as industrial applications and traffic control. Unfortunately, sensor data is subject to several sources of errors such as noise from external sources, hardware noise, inaccuracies and imprecision, and various environmental effects. Such errors may seriously impact the answer to any query posed to the sensors. In particular, they may yield imprecise or even incorrect and misleading answers which can be very significant if they result in immediate critical decisions or activation of actuators. In this paper, we present a framework for cleaning and querying noisy sensors. Specifically, we present a Bayesian approach for reducing the uncertainty associated with the data, that arise due to random noise, in an online fashion. Our approach combines prior knowledge of the true sensor reading, the noise characteristics of this sensor, and the observed noisy reading in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the reading. This cleaning step can be performed either at the sensor level or at the base-station. Based on our proposed uncertainty models and using a statistical approach, we introduce several algorithms for answering traditional database queries over uncertain sensor readings. Finally, we present a preliminary evaluation of our proposed approach using synthetic data and highlight some exciting research directions in this area.},

	abstract     = {Mobile and pervasive applications frequently rely on devices such as RFID antennas or sensors (light, temperature, motion) to provide them information about the physical world. These devices, however, are unreliable. They produce streams of information where portions of data may be missing, duplicated, or erroneous. Current state of the art is to correct errors locally (e.g., range constraints for temperature readings) or use spatial/temporal correlations (e.g., smoothing temperature readings). However, errors are often apparent only in a global setting, e.g., missed readings of objects that are known to be present, or exit readings from a parking garage without matching entry readings.In this paper, we present StreamClean, a system for correcting input data errors automatically using application defined global integrity constraints. Because it is frequently impossible to make corrections with certainty, we propose a probabilistic approach, where the system assigns to each input tuple the probability that it is correct.We show that StreamClean handles a large class of input data errors, and corrects them sufficiently fast to keep-up with input rates of many mobile and pervasive applications. We also show that the probabilities assigned by StreamClean correspond to a user's intuitive notion of correctness.},

Rather than collecting all the data in one location for centralized processing, we propose collecting hints (in the form of a histogram) about the data distribution, and using the hints to filter out unnecessary data and identify potential outliers. We show that this method can be used for detecting outliers in terms of two different definitions.

booktitle = {ACM/IEEE IoTDI},
year = {2021},
abstract = {Sensor data quality plays a fundamental role in increasing the adoption of IoT devices for environmental data collection. Due to the nature of the deployment, i.e., in-the-wild and in harsh environments, coupled with limitations of low-cost components, sensors are prone to failures. A significant fraction of faults result from drift and catastrophic faults in sensors' sensing components leading to serious data inaccuracies. However, it is challenging to detect faults by analyzing just the sensor data as a faulty sensor data can mimic non-faulty data and an anomalous sensor reading need not represent a faulty data. Existing data-centric approaches rely on additional contextual information or sensor redundancy to detect such faults. This paper presents a systematic approach to detect faults and drifts, by devising a novel sensor fingerprint called CurrentSense. CurrentSense captures the electrical characteristics of the hardware components in a sensor, with working, drifted, and faulty sensors having distinct fingerprints. This fingerprint is used to determine the sensors’ health, and compensate for drift or diagnose catastrophic faults without any contextual information. The CurrentSense approach is non-intrusive, and can be applied to a wide variety of environmental sensors. We show the working of the proposed approach with the help of air pollution sensors. We perform an extensive evaluation in both controlled setup and real-world deployments with 51 sensors across multiple cities for 8 months period. Our approach outperforms existing anomaly detectors and can detect and isolate faults with an F_1 score of 98% and compensate for sensor drift errors by 86%.},

	abstract = {Data are the cornerstone of digital sensors for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, which have been widely used in various fields from social development to human life. However, data failure because of various faults caused by the human or environmental causes may result in the sensor system failure. In order to solve this issue, an online and credible data integrity monitoring (DIM) method for digital sensors is proposed in this article. Overall, this article contributes in the following ways. First, we model the data failure by dividing it into format failure, timing failure, and value failure. Second, several heuristic rules are proposed for the detection and isolation of data failure. Third, the control mechanism named dual variable-length data monitoring window is introduced to improve the credibility of data recovery. Then, we set up a motion tracking platform based on accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, and conduct a series of experiments, such as numerical simulation experiments, static experiments, and turntable experiments to perform the comprehensive evaluation and verification on the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the data quality. Finally, the tradeoffs among the real time, computational complexity, and credibility of the proposed method are discussed, and it is expected to be applied to other digital sensor systems for IoT applications.},

Despite this, they frequently fail to operate in an ongoing fire, risking death and property damage. A significant fraction of faults result from drift, or reduced sensitivity, and other faults in smoke detectors' phototransistors (PTs). Existing approaches attempt to detect drift from the PT output in normal conditions (without smoke). However, we find that drifted PTs mimic the output of working PTs in normal conditions, but diverge in the presence of smoke, making this approach ineffective.This paper presents two novel approaches to systematically detect faults and measure and compensate for drift in smoke detectors' PTs. Our first approach, called FallTime, measures a PT "fingerprint," a unique electrical characteristic with distinct behavior for working, drifted, and faulty components. FallTime can be added to many existing smoke detector models in software alone, with no/minimal hardware modifications. Our second approach, DriftTestButton, is a mechanical test button that simulates the behavior of smoke when pressed. It offers a robust, straightforward approach to detect faults, and can measure and compensate for drift across the entire smoke detector system. We empirically evaluate both approaches and present extensive experimental results from actual smoke detectors deployed in a commercial building, along with custom-built smoke detectors. By conducting tests with live smoke, we show that both FallTime and DriftTestButton perform more effectively than existing fault tolerance techniques and stand to substantially reduce the risk that a smoke detector fails to alarm in the presence of smoke.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 19th ACM MobiSys}, year = {2021}, pages = {310–322}, numpages = {13}, keywords = {fault tolerance, drift detection, smoke detectors, phototransistors}, location = {Virtual Event, Wisconsin}}

	abstract = {With the proliferation of IoT sensors, the reliance on sensor telemetry has never been greater. Today numerous applications from smart agriculture to smart buildings and cities, rely on IoT telemetry to provide insights and to take decisions. However, due to the characteristics of these IoT deployments (in the wild, harsh conditions), sensors are prone to failures, leading to the generation of bad/dirty data. Hitherto, data-centric algorithms were used to determine the quality of the sensed data, which has several limitations and relies on additional contextual information or sensor redundancy. Recently, system-centric approaches based on sensor fingerprinting has shown to detect sensor faults reliably without any additional information. However, the sensor fingerprinting approach is validated only for specific sensors, is not robust to real-world conditions, and cannot scale to large-scale deployments. To this end, we propose a general, easy-to-use, scalable, and robust fault detection SDK called Verified Telemetry (VT) SDK. VT SDK builds on the sensor fingerprinting approach and can work with a wide variety of sensors (both analog and digital) and IoT devices with very minimal changes. We propose improved sensor fingerprinting algorithms that are robust to signal variations, sensor circuitry, and real-world conditions. VT SDK is implemented across numerous devices and we show its usage on several practical applications. Finally, VT SDK is made available for the community to address sensor fault detection in IoT deployments (https://aka.ms/verifiedtelemetry).},

	abstract = {Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensors are an integral part of modern living. They have diverse applications ranging from automatic lighting and heating control in smart buildings, towel dispensers in washrooms, security alarms (for intrusion detection) to even human detection robots (for search and rescue). Unfortunately, PIR sensors are prone to failures during deployment due to reasons such as environmental damage, incorrect installation and component degradation among others that can lead to incorrect or faulty data. Currently, such failures are typically detected using either : (a) heavily engineered data-driven, statistical approaches that can have high false positive rates due to unseen data patterns or (b) expensive methods that use additional hardware such as video cameras or a golden reference sensor. The second approach inhibits scalability.In this work, we first create a taxonomy for the most common PIR sensor failures. We then present PIRMedic---a physics-driven approach, implemented at the edge, to detect the various classes of failures. We show that we can both detect and diagnose the failures in a PIR sensor using an intrinsic hardware signal viz., the analog output from the pyroelectric element in the sensor. Using this hardware signal in conjunction with frequency analysis and supervised machine learning methods, we obtain a high accuracy of 98 -- 99\% in failure detection and diagnosis. We evaluate our methods using real-world deployments in three distinct locations, in different environment and usage conditions.},

	abstract = {Interoperability in the Internet of Things relies on a common data model that captures the necessary semantics for vendor independent application development and data exchange. However, traditional systems such as those in building management are vertically integrated and do not use a standard schema. A typical building can consist of thousands of data points. Third party vendors who seek to deploy applications like fault diagnosis need to manually map the building information into a common schema. This mapping process requires deep domain expertise and a detailed understanding of intricacies of each building's system. Our framework - Scrabble - reduces the mapping effort significantly by using a multi-stage active learning mechanism that exploits the structure present in a standard schema and learns from buildings that have already been mapped to the schema. Scrabble uses conditional random fields with transfer learning to represent unstructured building information in a reusable intermediate representation. This reusable representation is mapped to the schema using a multilayer perceptron. Our novel semantic model based active learning mechanism requires only minimal input from domain experts to interpret esoteric, idiosyncratic data points. We have evaluated Scrabble on five buildings with thousands of different entities and our method outperforms prior work by 59\%/162\% higher Accuracy/Macro-averaged-F1 in a building when 10 examples are provided by an expert in both cases. Scrabble achieves 99\% Accuracy with 100--160 examples for buildings with thousands of points while the other baselines cannot.},

	abstract = {The recent advances in the automation of metadata normalization and the invention of a unified schema --- Brick --- alleviate the metadata normalization challenge for deploying portable applications across buildings. Yet, the lack of compatibility between existing metadata normalization methods precludes the possibility of comparing and combining them. While generic machine learning (ML) frameworks, such as MLJAR and OpenML, provide versatile interfaces for standard ML problems, they cannot easily accommodate the metadata normalization tasks for buildings due to the heterogeneity in the inference scope, type of data required as input, evaluation metric, and the building-specific human-in-the-loop learning procedure.We propose Plaster, an open and modular framework that incorporates existing advances in building metadata normalization. It provides unified programming interfaces for various types of learning methods for metadata normalization and defines standardized data models for building metadata and timeseries data. Thus, it enables the integration of different methods via a workflow, benchmarking of different methods via unified interfaces, and rapid prototyping of new algorithms. With Plaster, we 1) show three examples of the workflow integration, delivering better performance than individual algorithms, 2) benchmark/analyze five algorithms over five common buildings, and 3) exemplify the process of developing a new algorithm involving time series features. We believe Plaster will facilitate the development of new algorithms and expedite the adoption of standard metadata schema such as Brick, in order to enable seamless smart building applications in the future.},
