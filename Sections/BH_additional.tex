The relative importance of features learnt by the model to predict the label of a sensor can vary from one deployment to another -- but the approach of using BH procedure to find relative importance of features followed by using SHAP values is general in nature. The end-goal is to find definitive features that can characterize the intrinsic signal, either in time and frequency domain. The features learnt by the model can vary from one building to another.
