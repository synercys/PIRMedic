\title{Physics-based Fault Analysis for Commodity PIR Sensors}
\titlenote{PIRMedic was first introduced as a conference paper in ACM BuildSys~\cite{10.1145/3486611.3486658}. In this work, we expand upon on \sol and provide additional insights on the different classes of faults. We accomplish this by adding a threshold-based technique to study Class I and III faults (\S\ref{subsec:aout_quiet_times}) and including experiments using the threshold algorithm to distinguish between them by evaluation in a cafeteria (\S\ref{subsubsec:cafeteria}). We also study the impact of incremental failures on Class III faults giving insights into impact of gradual degradation on the \aout signal with incremental accumulation of dust(\S\ref{subsec:incremental_dust}). Additionally, we study the impact of different types of foreign particles such as paper and tape on the sensor performance (\S\ref{subsec:foreign_additional}). More generally, we include a quantitative study to compare the impact of various faults on sensor performance (\S\ref{subsec:quantify} and Table~\ref{tbl:fault_degree}). We also study the fault detection accuracy of \sol as a function of pre-deployment training dataset size (\S\ref{subsec:fail_detection}). Lastly, we have study the nature of \aout from ceiling-mount PIR sensors (Fig.~\ref{fig:round_lens}). We have also made some editorial changes by: \ca adding a goals subsection in \S\ref{sec:intro}, \cb updating other physics-related sensor failure related work~\cite{10.1145/3458864.3466869, 10.1145/3576842.3582386}, \cc adding a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) summarizing some of the common questions in the appendix and lastly \cd including a 3D visualization of the PIR sensor drawn in Tinker CAD and adding more text explaining the different sensor subsystems.}
